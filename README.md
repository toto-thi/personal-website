# Personal Website

V1.

My first personal website, I think it's a good start for me even though the UX/UI is not designed by me I can still make it work (almost) in a different tech stack!! Hopefully there will be an update soon in the future.

## Getting started

Simply run the following command to test in your local environment:
```bash
npm install
```

and 

```bash
npm run dev
```

Feel free to edit the template in `content` and `components/sections`

## Deployment

I have deployed this website private version to Vercal, you can learn more how to deploy it via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments)
