The goal was to predict student grades in an online machine-learning course. After analyzing the data for key features, several models were tested: linear regression, random forest, SVM, and decision trees. The decision tree achieved perfect accuracy but raised overfitting concerns, while the random forest showed strong performance. This analysis helps in selecting the best models for future grade predictions.
