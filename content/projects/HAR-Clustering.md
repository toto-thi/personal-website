Clustering human activity data from accelerometer and gyroscope readings, this project applies K-Means and DBSCAN methods, enhanced through dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE, to achieve precise activity grouping. The approach demonstrates how tuning and dimensionality reduction impact cluster structures, providing valuable insights into patterns of activity recognition.
