By scraping data from multiple travel websites, this tool compares flight options by extracting, cleaning, and analyzing key details like price, duration, layover times, and transit locations. The analysis reveals trends in pricing based on factors such as airline, layover duration, and departure times. Additionally, it addresses the challenges of scraping dynamic websites and provides users with a filtering tool to sort flights by price, airline, and duration.
