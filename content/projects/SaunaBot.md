This was created to schedule a sauna turn at our student dormitory (Tys). Our dormitory Sauna is spacious enough to be used individually, so I came up with the idea of sharing it since we are international students. But previously, we all kept forgetting when the next sauna would be for us. And who booked it? We want to avoid crashing book slots and some fun jokes.
