Collaborated with the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Turku University Hospital, focusing on extracting and processing Edi signals from medical devices. This involved transforming signals into the frequency domain and developing predictive models to forecast apnea episodes up to one minute in advance. The project emphasizes continuous algorithm optimization, with ongoing efforts to document findings in a research paper.
