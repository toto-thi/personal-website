This project applies machine learning to classify tweet sentiment as positive or negative. It evaluates two models: Logistic Regression, which provided solid baseline performance, and BERT, which delivered a slight accuracy improvement but demanded more computational resources. The results illustrate the trade-offs between model complexity and resource efficiency in NLP tasks.
